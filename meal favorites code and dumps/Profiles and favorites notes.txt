once they like it, saves category, save it in sessions
create table that stores user and 10 columns(category names)
login and checks likes and pulls random category.

create button that lets you update a value as favorited in the favorite table which will have user, food, and favorited column
once in the table, let it be able to printed in the profile page where the user is
print the food and if possible the recipe. could use both testmeals and fave
use the where clause to help sort through the tables for things like favorited being yes for this user

The profile needs 5 likes and 5 dislikes which can be buttons
needs a cook book or a list of all the favorites which is just querying where favorite is yes
daily recommendations is a little tougher because it needs to look at what you liked or favorited and print a randomized food where the category is the same

store the favorite to a table and have it store the data temporarily in a session to be printed in the profile
