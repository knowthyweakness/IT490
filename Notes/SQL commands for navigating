sudo mysql -u root -p gets you into the sql shell

USE databaseName; selects the database
There is no unuse. just select another db

SHOW DATABASES; lets you see all the current databases

SHOW TABLES; this needs a DB to be selected but it shows all tables in that DB

SELECT * FROM tableName; shows the data in the table. it returns an empty set message if the table is blank
